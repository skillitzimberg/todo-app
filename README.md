# APPLICATION #2: TO-DO APP
## Description
If you’re going to learn to program you have to build a TO-DO application...it’s a right of passage!  

This TO-DO app is going to continue to build up your HTML/CSS & Javascript skills. Similar to your clock application, the focus of building this is functionality...NOT styling. So focus on getting new TO-DO’s to show up and to check off TO-DO’s. Don’t worry about making everything look perfect.
Below are some examples of TO-DO apps you can use for inspiration. The key is to do it your own way and have fun with it!  

The expectations for the project are listed in [DELIVERABLES](./DELIVERABLES.md).  
The steps I took and other errata are in [PLANNING](./PLANNING.md). I tried my best to have the commits track closely with this document.  

I purposefully did this project as fast as I could, looking up as little as possible because I wanted my gut instincts to be the first thing I get feedback on.
