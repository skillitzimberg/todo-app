# APPLICATION #2: TO-DO APP
## Description
If you’re going to learn to program you have to build a TO-DO application...it’s a right of passage!  

The expectations for the project are listed in [DELIVERABLES](./DELIVERABLES.md).  
The steps I took and other errata are in [PLANNING](./PLANNING.md). I tried my best to have the commits track closely with this document.
